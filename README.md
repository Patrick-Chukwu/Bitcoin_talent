# Bitcoin_talent
An 18-Week Mentoring Program Empowering Talent in the Bitcoin Ecosystem.

## Objective of the program
Bitcoin talent is an 18-week long program with 3 phases that will help ambitious and young career starters to break into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Introduction

With this program, theey seek to empower innovators to dive into Bitcoin to understand the largest (measured by market capitalization) blockchain project out there, to become leaders in this quickly developing field, and to build the basis for a successful career path. With Bitcoin, a new financial architecture (and asset, think “digital gold”) has arisen globally allowing people previously excluded from the international financial system to participate. Bitcoin is the most well-known and biggest blockchain project. It does not depend on the participation of traditional players like banks that act as financial intermediaries but is accessible to virtually anyone in a peer-to-peer manner with the minimum requirements of having a PC or smartphone, access to the Internet, and the willingness to learn. Thus, Bitcoin expands transactions on a blockchain from basic peer-to-peer cash functionality to the more complex Lightning network, starting to reach new markets (“banking the unbanked”). With the current time of crises, it is more than rational to understand Bitcoin deeply.
